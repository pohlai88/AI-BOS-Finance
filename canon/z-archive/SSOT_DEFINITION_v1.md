# SSOT Definition (Legacy)

**Original Date:** 2025-12-11  
**Original Status:** Canonical

---

## Supersession Notice

This document has been **superseded** by:

- **CONT_01 v2.2.0** - Section "Document Status" defines SSOT hierarchy
- **canon/contracts/CONT_01_CanonIdentity.md** - The stamped production contract

The SSOT principles are now embedded directly in the contract header:

> **SSOT:** This document is the **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)** for the Canon Identity Contract.  
> **Derived Documents:** `README.md` is a navigation index derived from this contract.
